### Video Game Sales Analysis & Prediction

**Project Overview:** In both my Data Visualizations and Data Programming courses at UW I chose to analyze international video game sales data from 2013-2019.

The Data Visualization project focused on analyzing sales traits through a diverse set of visualizations portraying the relationships between several different attributes in the dataset. I created a Tableau presentation board that identified sales characteristics of publishers, genres, and domestic sales success that could be used by a marketing or leadership team to inform decision making and future investments.

The Data Programming project was based around the development of a rudimentary machine learning model that could estimate where certain games would see successful sales numbers across the different international markets. The model was trained on the international sales data from the given time period and developed using decision tree classification in the scikit-learn package. The project model had a 78% accuracy score for predicting what region a game would be most successful in.
