### Video Game Sales Analysis & Prediction

**Project Overview:** In both my Data Visualizations and Data Programming courses at UW I chose to analyze international video game sales data from 2013-2019.

The Data Visualization project focused on analyzing sales traits through a diverse set of visualizations portraying the relationships between several different attributes in the dataset. I created a Tableau presentation board that identified sales characteristics of publishers, genres, and domestic sales success that could be used by a marketing or leadership team to inform decision making and future investments.

The Data Programming project was based around the development of a rudimentary machine learning model that could estimate where certain games would see successful sales numbers across the different international markets. The model was trained on the international sales data from the given time period and developed using decision tree classification in the scikit-learn package. The project model had a 78% accuracy score for predicting what region a game would be most successful in.

**Improvements:** The accuracy score could be improved through further model engineering and attribute tweaking. I also made an attempt at developing a regression model that predicted the total sales numbers of games, but due to the incomplete nature of the sales data in the datasets that I merged together I was unable to create an accurate model (or test accurately). I would like to seek out datasets containing the complete scope of sales data in order to merge it with the dataset from this project in order to develop that sales prediction model.

### Alcohol & Life Expectancy

**Project Overview:** The final project in my Computer Science and Social Science course at UW asked each group to analyze a social issue or question with data science techniques. My partner and I chose to look at the relationship between alcohol consumption and life expectancy on an international scale.

Every few years a new headline is circulated that strongly declares a positive or negative relationship between casual alcohol usage. These reports are usually written with the sole focus of reader engagement and are based upon small scale group studies, so my group chose to look at the issue more analytically by diving into the World Bank data repository which houses decades of government supplied demographic and behavioral data from around the world.

We worked with the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the alcohol consumption level of a given country and it's respective life expectancy, and through our statistical tests we failed to reject that hypothesis. Through statistical analysis, visualizations, and regression models we clearly uncovered the GDP or any given country as a confounding variable.
