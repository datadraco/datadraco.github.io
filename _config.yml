  Currently working as a Statistical Research Programmer at Chapman University while pursuing a Masters in Data Science at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science at the University of California - Irvine. While completing my BA in Mathematics from the University of Washington, I found a passion for analysis and visualizations as tools for driving positive change and answering complex questions.
